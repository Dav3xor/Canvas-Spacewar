This is an implementation of Spacewar, (arguably) the first video 
game, originally written in 1958.

This implementation is designed to be played in a modern browser,
and is written in Javascript + Canvas.  The code, except for css
is all in one file. It's pretty easy to understand, and might
work as a starter for your own javascript/canvas game.
